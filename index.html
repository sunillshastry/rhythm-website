        <h1 class="heading">Installation and Setup</h1>

        <p>
          Rhythm is designed and built using Python 3, it is recommend for the
          user to have Python 3.5 or a higher version of Python installed on
          their computer device. This is a console based application and
          consequently it is assumed that the user is aware of running a Python
          program on their console. If you do not have Python 3.5 or a higher
          version installed, please follow the provided steps below.
        </p>

          ></iframe>
        </p>

        <ul class="install-steps">
          <li>
            To install Python, please visit the official
            <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Python.org</a> website.
            Click on the "Download Python" button available. After downloading,
            please make sure you initiate the actual installation process of
            Python. (IMPORTANT NOTE: During the first few stages of the
            installation, you will see a checkbox saying "Add Python to PATH",
            please SELECT the check-mark!)
          </li>

          <li>
            On finishing the Python installation process, depending on the
            device, you <em>may</em> need to restart your device.
          </li>

          <li>
            Once you have completed the process and rebooted your device, you
            can run Python language right on your terminal or command prompt. To
            run Python, open up your terminal and type the following command
          </li>

          <div class="cli">python</div>

          <li>
            However, if you see an error that pops up when you type python on
            your terminal, it only means that you have not installed Python
            correctly to your device. In such a case, please view the video
            through a link I have provided above, which shows how to install
            Python for Windows and Mac (by Corey Schafer), it can be very
            helpful.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="small-heading">Command Line Navigation</h3>
        <p>
          Rhythm is a console based application and consequently it is assumed
          that the user is aware of running a Python program on their console.
          However, it is not mandatory to know it, if a person reading this is
          not aware of any basic command line interfaces (CLI), I have included
          a short reference below to get some idea on running the
          <strong>main.py</strong> Rhythm file (or any Python file in that
          regard). Open up your terminal or command prompt and try out these
          following CLI commands.
        </p>

        <ul class="install-steps">
          <li>
            <span class="code">pwd</span>: The print working directory (pwd)
            command prints the current location of your prompt, which will most
            likely be the User files or Desktop. Type out the command to check
            where your terminal's initial location starts from.
          </li>

          <li>
            <span class="code">cd</span>: Change directory (cd) helps you
            navigate from one folder to another, it is very similar to "double
            clicking" a folder to open it, the
            <span class="code">cd</span> command lets you do the exact same, but
            on the command line.
          </li>

          <li>
            <span class="code">ls</span>: List (ls) lets you view all the files
            and folders present in a particular folder, when you type out 'ls'
            you view all the files present at the location you're currently on
            the command line. (PRO-TIP: you can view the hidden files present in
            a folder by typing <span class="code">ls -a</span>)
          </li>

          <li>
            <span class="code">clear</span>: The clear command is a little
            different and is limited to the command line only, which means there
            is no equivalent command for it when navigating using a GUI. The
            <span class="code">clear</span> command is pretty simple, it clears
            your console, it does not terminate any process, but it only builds
            up some extra space for better visibility while using the console.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Please know that there are a lot more CLI commands than just the ones
          mentioned above, I have stated a few important ones for the scope of
          the project. For programmers, CLI is a very efficient tool and it is
          used quite often for several purposes. To learn more about CLI and CLI
          commands, please visit the following links

        <h3 class="small-heading">Required Packages for Rhythm</h3>
        <p>
          A Python library is a reusable chunk of code that you may want to
          include in your programs/ projects. Compared to languages like C or
          C++, Python libraries do not pertain to any specific context in
          Python. Here, a ‘library’ loosely describes a collection of core
          modules. The Python Standard Library is a collection of exact syntax,
          token, and semantics of Python. It comes bundled with core Python
          distribution.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rhythm is built using the Python 3 programming language and uses the
          following libraries:
        </p>
        <ul class="install-steps">
          <li>
            <span class="code">requests</span>: Requests is a simple, yet
            elegant HTTP library. Requests allows you to send HTTP/1.1 requests
            extremely easily. There’s no need to manually add query strings to
            your URLs, or to form-encode your <span class="code">PUT</span> &
            <span class="code">POST</span> data — but nowadays, just use the
            <span class="code">json</span> method!
          </li>

          <li>
            <span class="code">os</span>: This module provides a portable way of
            using operating system dependent functionality. For this project we
            have used <span class="code">os.path</span>. You do not have to
            "manually" install <span class="code">os</span> as it comes with the
            Python Standard Library.
          </li>

          <li>
            <span class="code">rhythm</span>: This is a custom module created by
            Sunil Shastry. You will not find this on any Python documentation
            page, because this specific module is used only for our project. To
            read the documentation about the
            <span class="code">rhythm</span> module (Python class), download the
            project from
            <a href="https://github.com/sunillshastry/rhythm">GitHub</a> and you
            can find <span class="code">rhythm.txt</span> file inside the
            project.
          </li>

          <li>
            <span class="code">termcolor</span>: This module allows ANSII color
            formatting for output in terminal. Although this module does not
            have anything in depth with our project, it is mainly used to make
            the user experience better while working on the terminal.
            Installation of this package can be omitted, although it is
            suggested not to.
          </li>

          <li>
            <span class="code">colorama</span>: This is also an optional module
            that can be installed to make the user experience feel better.
            Colorama makes ANSI escape character sequences (for producing
            colored terminal text and cursor positioning) work under Microsoft
            Windows.
          </li>

          <li>
            <span class="code">pyfiglet</span>: Pyfiglet is a full port of
            FIGlet (http://www.figlet.org/) into pure python. It takes ASCII
            text and renders it in ASCII art fonts (like the title above, which
            is the 'block' font). Just like the two modules mentioned above,
            this module is not strictly required to run Rhythm but it is
            suggested to have it installed.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          <strong
            >In order to have the Rhythm application running accurately, you
            must have the <span class="code">requests</span> library installed,
            the rest can be omitted. However, the other packages can surely be
            nice to have, as they help Rhythm perform better in terms of the
            user experience.</strong
          >
        </p>

        <h3 class="small-heading">Installing Modules</h3>
        <p>
          Installing a module/library in Python can be pretty simple and
          straight-forward. It is something even a novice can easily achieve
          without much confusion and complication. To install a package, open up
          your terminal or command prompt and type the following.
        </p>

        <div class="cli">pip install (package-name)</div>
        <p>
          <span class="code">pip</span> is a package installer for Python. You
          can use pip to install packages from the Python Package Index and
          other indexes. <span class="code">pip</span> is the PyPA recommended
          tool for installing Python packages. To install the required packages
          for our project, please type the following commands:
        </p>

        <div class="cli">pip install requests</div>

        <div class="cli">pip install termcolor</div>

        <div class="cli">pip install colorama</div>

        <div class="cli">pip install pyfiglet</div>

        <p>
          You need to install the packages one at a time, it might take some
          time to download depending on your internet speed, once you have
          successfully downloaded all the required modules for the project,
          proceed ahead.

        <h2 class="heading">How to use Rhythm?</h2>
        <p>
          Once you have downloaded and installed the project files and the
          required Python libraries, head over to your terminal or command
          prompt. Since Rhythm is primarily based on the console, one can use
          the application through their terminal or command prompt only.
          However, Rhythm provides an option for the user to download external
          text files if needed. To run the Rhythm project, navigate to the
          project directory using some
          <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/articles/command-line-commands"
            >CLI commands</a
          >
          and run the following command.
        </p>

        <div class="cli">python main.py</div>

        <p>
          If you are using a Mac, the above command may or may not work since
          Mac comes with a Python 2 version pre-installed on it already. To
          tackle this issue, please try running the following command.
        </p>

        <div class="cli">python3 main.py</div>

        <p>
          On the terminal, by writing out
          <span class="code">python</span> followed by the Python file name, the
          corresponding Python file is executed right in the terminal, unlike
          most softwares that involve a "click", "hover", "drag", Rhythm is used
          through the terminal. Such applications are generally known as console
          applications, and on the contrary, softwares that involve such
          "clicks", "hover" and "drag" options are known as GUI (Graphical User
          Interface) applications.
        </p>

        <p>
          A full reference about running Python on the command line can be found
          <a
            href="https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/running-a-python-script"
            >here</a
          >
        </p>

        <p>
          On running the Rhythm application, you will be able you enter the song
          and artist name and the software will do its working in fetching the
          lyrics for, this process might take a while depending on your internet
          speed and the lyrics.ovh public API's access network. However, it is
          very unlikely for the application to take more than a minute. On
          receiving the response from the API, Rhythm informs you that your song
          lyrics have successfully been loaded. At this point, you are given two
          options, you can either view the lyrics on the terminal or you can
          download a text file containing the lyrics to your song. The
          application asks for an input where you are allowed to enter either
          "view" or "text", and on pressing the "text" option, you will have to
          provide Rhythm a name for the file and Rhythm will automatically
          create a "downloads" folder in the same directory and your text file
          can be present inside the "downloads" folder.
        </p>

        <h2 class="heading">Facing Issues?</h2>
        <p>
          Rhythm requires you to download and install loads of packages and
          files, for a non-developer point of view, this can be very frustrating
          and error prone. The explanations provided in this documentation may
          or may not have the perfect description about running the software,
          and in places where you can easily go wrong, I have provided links to
          YouTube videos that help you visualize your tasks. However, if you are
          still having trouble downloading any file or package, or in case you
          find an error while running your Rhythm application, I would sincerely
          request you to e-mail me regarding the problem. I would truly
          appreciate it if you let me know what the problem is and when it
          occurred. I will try my best to provide a response to you at the
          earliest, and of course try and fix the problem that is at large with
          Rhythm.

        <p>
          While developing the Rhythm project, there have been a lot of external
          tools that are used and that have been extremely helpful in the
          process of developing the application. These include packages that
          have made my task easier. Below, there are all the references and
          credits that are worth mentioning for making my life easier.

          <li>
            <a href="https://lyricsovh.docs.apiary.io/">lyrics.ovh</a> A simple
            API to retrieve the lyrics of a song, this is the brain of the
            Rhythm application, the lyrics provided for every song is from this
            public API available for usage for over ten programming languages.
          </li>

          <li>
            <a href="https://pypi.org/project/requests/">Requests Module</a>,
            together with lyrics.ovh, requests is a Python module that helps you
            send a request to external servers using the .get() method and
            access the data from it. It's safe to say that the requests module
            has truly been the brawn of the Rhythm application.

              >Corey Schafer's YouTube Channel</a
            >. Corey Schafer's YouTube channel has been very crucial not only
            while building the application but as you could probably guess, a
            couple of his videos proved to be vital for providing proper
            documentation for the Rhythm application, especially for people who
            are non-programmers.

          <li>
            <a href="https://pypi.org/">Python Package Index</a> is the main hub
            for installing all and any Python package, it has provided a lot of
            clarity while selecting for the right package, you may not know but
            there are thousands of Python packages available and choosing the
            best ones are always a task.
